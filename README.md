# software-engineering

I have put up our group project for software engineering in which we are studying about SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE.
We are given the topic - BUS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
Our actors are - 
  1. registered user
  2. unregistered user
  3. admin
  4. owner(of the busses)
  5. driver

we have prepared -
  1. SRS(software requirement specification)
  2. E-R diagram(entity-relationship)
  3. DFD(Data flow diagram)
  4. Use case diagram
  5. Sequence diagram
  
 We are finally moving to the development phase, in which we plan to use Django framework for MVC model and MySQL database as our database management system(we mostly demonstrate the use of create, read, updata & delete SQL commands.)
 
 Further, we also plan to move it to the testing phase.
